# Getting started

- Ensure you have node version 16 installed (suggestion: v16.5).
- Ensure if you are using Windows to use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
- Run `yarn build <addon name>` directory to build a specific addon.
- Run `yarn build:all` directory to build all addons.

The `yarn build` & `yarn build:watch` scripts will build run `tsc` to build the addon typescript files into javascript in the `dist` folder.

# Verification
You can always run `yarn storybook` to start a local storybook version that uses the addon. This will allow you to test the code you are adding to the repo.
